SQL Guidelines
1. Setting Up a Database
To create a new database:


CREATE DATABASE database_name;
To use an existing database:


USE database_name;
2. Creating Tables
To create a new table:


CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
3. Inserting Data
To insert a single row:


INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
To insert multiple rows:


INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES
    (value1, value2, ...),
    (value3, value4, ...),
    ...;
4. Reading Data
To select all columns:


SELECT * FROM table_name;
To select specific columns:


SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
With conditions:


SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
5. Updating Data
To update data:


UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
6. Deleting Data
To delete all rows:


DELETE FROM table_name;
To delete specific rows:


DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
7. Joining Tables
Inner Join:


SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
Left Join:


SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
8. Aggregating Data
To count rows:


SELECT COUNT(column) FROM table_name;
To find the average:

SELECT AVG(column) FROM table_name;
9. Sorting Data
To sort in ascending order:


SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column ASC;
To sort in descending order:


SELECT * FROM table_name
ORDER BY column DESC;
10. Dropping Tables and Databases
To drop a table:


DROP TABLE table_name;
To drop a database:

DROP DATABASE database_name;

These are just the basics, but they should give you a good start in working with SQL databases.
